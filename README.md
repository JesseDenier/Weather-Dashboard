# Weather-Dashboard

A useful tool for checking the weather in different cities.

## Description

Using a 3rd party API from Open Weather I created custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript (With Jquery) to display current and forecasted weather statistics for any city in the world.
Here is a screenshot of my completed work as of 1.30.24.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Here is a link to the website: https://jessedenier.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
This webpage can be opened and interacted with immediately. Austin Texas is the default city. You can see the current weather in the largest block, as well as get a general idea of the weather based on the background image. Additionally the 5 day forecast is listed below. The city can be changed by either clicking on a city in the aside or typing in a new city and clicking the search button.

## Credits

All credit for code goes to myself, Jesse Denier. I did use an API created by Open Weather (https://openweathermap.org/).
